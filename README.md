2018 ATDP Summer Final Project


Brief Description:

Electricity Clicker is a clicker game where the main goal is to get as much energy as possible by clicking the energy icon on the left side of the screen

How to Play:

Everything is bought with energy, which is generated by clicking the energy icon on the left side of the screen. The amount of energy generated is displayed at the bottom left-hand corner of the screen. Energy can also be generated by buying the items in the center of the screen, when their bar fills up a lot of energy will be generated. For the same cost, one can also upgrade the item to lower the time it takes for the bar to fill up. On the upper-right side of the screen one can buy an upgrade to their click, which adds one energy every time you click and so on. Lastly, underneath that, are the assistants which automatically buy the items corresponding to their names.
